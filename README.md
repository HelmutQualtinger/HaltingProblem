# Halting Problem

## Description
This hypothetical function 

```def program_stops_on_input(program: str, input_data: str) -> bool:```

takes a program and an input and returns in finite time whether the program stops on that input. It does not run it but analyse it. It is not possible to write this function. 
There are problems which will be forever unanswered. This is one of them. Such 
questions are called undecidable. And can be formulated in nor more than a few lines of code.
A brief description of the project.
